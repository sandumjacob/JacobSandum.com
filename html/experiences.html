                    <p>I was appointed by head officers of the UW-Madison Cybersecurity club as the technical involvement officer. This club leadership position mainly consists of helping other members with advanced cybersecurity skills involved in CTF competitions, such as reverse engineering, exploitation, and forensics. It also involves administrative tasks such as maintaining the club website and attracting new members.</p>

                    <p>Minnetonka Research served as a way to explore academic research in the field of cybersecurity. I began this exploration by creating a homelab, which included several virtual machines running on an isolated LAN. With this homelab, I created a Python script to remotely deploy malware samples onto the homelab and monitor network traffic. This was done in an effort to improve the process of evaluating intelligent network intrusion detection systems published in academic papers.</p>
